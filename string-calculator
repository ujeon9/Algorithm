#Create a program to calculate a specific string
#Enter English characters and calculate Bab as 1 point and baby as -2 points out of the string
#The base score is 50 points and is calculated only once if Babbab (or Bab, or baby), and only baby if Babbaby.
#If Bab and baby are combined like one word, baby is processed only

# ex) bab is baby  => 50 + 1 - 2  => output : 49
# babbab is baby  => 50 + 1 - 2  => output : 49
# babbabbaby is babybababy  => 50 -2 - 2  => output : 46

score = 50
str = 'babbabbaby is babybababy '

for word in str.split(' '):
    if ('baby' in word):
        score=score - 2
    elif ('bab' in word):
        score = score + 1

print(score)
